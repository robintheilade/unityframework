<strong>About</strong>
<br />
This framework contains common data structures, objects and methods that are shared across my assets and if you like you may use them in your own projects as well.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Features</strong>
<br />
Data structures<br />
- Quadtree<br />
Helper Methods<br />
- Random Vector3's<br />
- Horizontal/Vertical GUILayout<br />
- Equal comparison of TreeInstance instances<br />
- Time measuring of code

<br />
<br />
<strong>Why</strong><br />
During development of a few Unity assets I came to realize that I needed to combine code from the assets into an assembly for better keeping track of versions and since the assets were sharing code it seemed smart to create a framework assembly.
